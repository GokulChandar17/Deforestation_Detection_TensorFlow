**Objective:**
Developed a comprehensive deforestation monitoring system leveraging remote sensing, machine learning, and geographic information systems (GIS) technologies. The project aimed to utilize TensorFlow as a base for building EfficientNetV2 models to classify satellite images, comparing forest images with time series data to identify deforestation patterns and trends.

**Key Contributions:**

Integration of Technologies: Combined remote sensing, machine learning, and GIS technologies to create a robust deforestation monitoring system. Leveraged satellite-based remote sensing for real-time monitoring of forest cover changes, machine learning algorithms for automatic detection of deforestation patterns, and GIS for data integration and visualization.

Model Development: Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to build EfficientNetV2 models for classifying satellite images with high accuracy. Trained the models on the EuroSAT dataset, which consists of labeled samples covering various land cover classes, achieving over 90% accuracy in forest classification.

Time Series Analysis: Employed the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset, a time-series analysis of Landsat images, for monitoring global forest extent and change. Integrated Earth Engine to perform time series forecasting and analyze trends in deforestation over time, enhancing understanding of deforestation dynamics.

**Impact:**
The project contributes to environmental conservation efforts by providing a comprehensive monitoring system for deforestation detection and analysis.
